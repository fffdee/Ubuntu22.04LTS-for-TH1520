The file /usr/share/doc/ebtables/examples/sysvinit/ebtables.init is a typical
sysvinit script for you to use as /etc/init.d/ebtables.

This script in the example is the one previously provided by the
ebtables package, but now no sysvinit script is installed by default.

Read the script carefully before using it, as is just an example.
You will likely require to manually edit and install the script in order to
properly use it.
