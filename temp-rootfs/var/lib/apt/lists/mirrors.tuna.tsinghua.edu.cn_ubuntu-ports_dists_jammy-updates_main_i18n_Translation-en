 provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly. This
 may involve setting up the network and storage devices to configuring SSH
 access key and many other aspects of a system. Later on the cloud-init will
 also parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was passed to
 the instance.

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.

Description-md5: dcb442c6f30672e4b3a86ff7e3907584
Description-en: async fingerprint library of fprint project, gir bindings
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.
 .
 libfprint is the centre of efforts, this component does the dirty job of
 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.

Package: libfuzzer-15-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Package: llvm-13
Description-md5: 07d463911771b9679a5f0131f40992d4
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent

Package: python3-swift
Description-md5: 72c8e0f7c41fa180184a3c3196e4facc
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python 3 libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
